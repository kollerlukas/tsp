# Formalising Theory of Approximating the Travelling-Salesman Problem

This repository contains the formalizations for my Interdisipliary Project at TU Munich.

For my project I have formalized parts of section 21.1, *Approximation Algorithms for the TSP*, from [1]. 
I have formalized and formally verified two approximation algorithms, the DoubleTree and the Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm, for the Metric TSP. I have also formalized an L-reduction from the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem with maximum degree of 4 to the Metric TSP, which proves the MaxSNP-hardness of the Metric TSP.
